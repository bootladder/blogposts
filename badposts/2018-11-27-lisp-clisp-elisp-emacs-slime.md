title: Lisp clisp elisp Emacs SLIME
---
# First thoughts
* Evaluating expressions in the editor is awesome.  I've used it in Java with IntelliJ, during debugging but in emacs/SLIME with a single key chord it's a different experience
* Emacs uses Elisp by default, so evaluating expressions in Emacs only works for developing Elisp, unless you use SLIME.  Need to understand SLIME.
* From land of lisp, discovering that macros can generate (defun) calls is awesome.
  * And, creating a game REPL that converts nice commands "walk west" to LISP expressions (walk west) is awesome.
* Learning new keyboard shortcuts for both Emacs and SLIME at the same time is hard.
  * For text editing purposes I still think VIM is better right now.
