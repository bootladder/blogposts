# Embedded Systems Development

I specialize in firmware development and testing.  Having both a background in electronics and software,
plus a passion for testing, I have a unique set of skills and approach to creating embedded systems.  

My portfolio spans wide, including eg.  

* C/C++, GNU tools, CMake
* ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers
* Embedded Linux application development
* Wireless communication
* Unit testing

## 1. Firmware Capabilities

#### Wide Scope
Firmware is a misunderstood field of engineering.  Its role is growing rapidly, covering more territory.
It is getting increasingly harder to break off an isolated project for a firmware engineer to handle.
This is largely due to the connected nature of new products.  Firmware is related to more things now,
which gives a firmware developer more constraint and less ability to act independently.  
  
#### Product Scope
When clients work with me, they get high-quality firmware deliverables but also the confidence that
the work is correct and acceptable.  This is because I think about product scope, not firmware scope.
In other words, I independently deliver and I also am a second set of eyes covering a comprehensive scope.  

In a given day I may talk to sales people about product issues, talk to a CM about verifying a BOM item,
review schematic changes, discuss product feasibility with a VP.  All of this for the benefit of the product itself
and ensuring the quality of my firmware.  
  
At the end of the day, what is possible and not is often in the realm of firmware.
I have been down the road enough times, and I know how to avoid risk and ensure success.  


## 2. Frameworks, Testing, Coaching

I am big on frameworks.  I use them, create them, and teach people the philosophy and the how-to.
There are a lot of hot topics going around like testing, CI/CD, agile.
But it is a lot easier to say than to do.
I've learned it from the best, applied it heavily, and seen what works and what doesn't.  

Sometimes you just need a kick-start and you'll be on your way.
