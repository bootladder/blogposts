    Hello, my name is Steve Anderson.  I am an engineer dedicated to excellence in embedded systems.  
    Specifically in AUTOMATED TESTING!  

  
    In the 21st century world of embedded systems, requirements change faster than ever.
    Only those products which can adapt, literally to changing interfaces, will survive.  
    The changes are happening latest when the risk is greatest, and the risk mitigator is automated testing.
  
    
    I am currently looking for projects.
    I am interested in working with you!  
  
  
* **Custom Test Frameworks and Test Beds**  
    * Whatever your product is, it has atleast 1 interface, and I create frameworks for tests to drive those interfaces
    * I can deliver a **turn key solution** or any component within.
    * We develop extra software for tests, let's develop extra hardware for tests.  
    * Cutting quality in test systems is a terrible idea.  Test hardware, firmware, software and systems should have AT LEAST the quality of that in production.  Let's do it right.

* **Automation**
    * I specialize in FULL AUTOMATION.  Triggering, all the way to customized reports, can happen without any manual intervention.
    * Whether your company uses Jenkins, Atlassian, a custom tool, or nothing, we will achieve full automation.

* **Training**
    * You know your product best.  You should be in control of your tools to get the most leverage from them.  Test automation tools are no exception, and training is a core part of my service.  I can train a team from the ground up, or fit in with processes already in place.

 
* **Version Control and Continuous Integration**  
    * In order to achieve full automation, there are some fundamentals which come from software engineering that you must have.  I can help you say yes, you have all of the below:
         * You test what you ship, ship what you test. 
         * You can deterministically build and rebuild any version
         * Your binaries are built and stored on a server
  
* **Development**  
I also provide embedded systems and software development services.  Feel free to inquire about anything related to product development.
