‘’’c++

Hello, team.

My name is Steve Anderson. I’m an engineer, dedicated to excellence in embedded systems, and specifically in automated testing.

It seems that in this age of embedded systems, requirements for success change faster than ever. Only those whose products can adapt, literally to constantly changing interfaces, will survive. These changes are happening latest when the risk is the greatest, and the risk mitigator is - you guessed it - automated testing.

I am currently open to accepting new projects, and would love to work with you!

* **Custom Test Frameworks and Test Beds**
  * Whatever your product is, it has at least 1 interface. I can assist with creating frameworks for tests to drive those interfaces.
  * I can deliver a **turn key solution**, or any component within.
  * Since there’s extra software developed for tests, let’s develop extra hardware for tests.
  * Cutting quality in test systems? Horrible idea. Test hardware, firmware, software, and systems should have AT LEAST the quality in production. Let me help you do it right.

* **Automation**
  * I specialize in FULL AUTOMATION, from triggering all the way to customized reports, which can now happen without any manual intervention.
* Whether your company uses Jenkins, Atlassian, a custom tool, or nothing at all, we can achieve this.

* **Version Control and Continuous Integration**
  * There are many fundamentals which come from software engineering, which you must have in order to achieve full automation. I can assist in helping you say YES, you do have all of the below:
    * Test what you ship, ship what you test
    * Deterministically build and rebuild of any version
    * Binaries built and stored on a server

* **Training**
  * You know your product best. You should be in control of your tools to be able to get the most leverage from them. Test automation tools are no exception, and training is a core part of my service. I can train a team from the ground up, or I can find my fit with the process already in place. 

* **Development**
  * I also provide embedded systems and software development services. Please feel free to inquire about anything related to product development.
